# env-moosetracker-android

Android mobile app that allows hunters to participate in moose conservation and management.

 ## Features

## Usage

## Requirements
Minimum Android version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (API level 14).
Built with Android Studio 3.1.4. Uses API 27 SDK (Android 8.1 Oreo).

## Installation
1. Install / update to Android Studio 3.1.4.
2. Open SDK Manager to ensure you have the Android 8.1 Oreo SDK (API 27) installed.
3. Clone the repository and open the WildlifeTracker project in Android Studio. The Gradle build should be able to install other dependencies (Google Play Services etc.) automatically.
4. If running on a physical device, configure your device to allow USB debugging through the [Developer Options screen](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

From there you should be able to build and run to simulators or connected Android devices.

NOTE: the Maps tab uses the Google Maps API. For this to work properly you need a valid Google API key. This means you must register an app project on the Google Cloud Platform Console, and generate a Google API key which you can add to the `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`. For details on this process, consult the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup#key).
